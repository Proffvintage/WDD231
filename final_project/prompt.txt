I am choosing to go with a car cleaning service website called Uchiha car care.

I want the website to host a platform where customers can:
   Gallery - see a gallery of before and after photos or videos
   About Us - get to know the company and the employees working in their home
   Pricing and Services - easily navigate through services: exterior, interior, distances etc. with a quote calculator or genaric pricing
    - tips and tricks sort of blog style page for anyone to share what works for them

I wanted to create this website because I have a desire to meet people who own luxurious cars
and in the future I can make a website to create awareness
