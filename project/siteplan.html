    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>Clean Sweep is a cleaning service website designed to support 
        a future small business by providing a user-friendly platform 
        for potential customers. The site will showcase before-and-after 
        galleries, introduce the company and its team, and offer transparent 
        pricing for various services including home, room, garage, and move-in/move-out 
        cleanings. It will also feature a quote calculator to help users estimate costs 
        and a community-driven blog where people can share cleaning tips and tricks. 
        This project serves as a practical foundation for launching a real-world cleaning business, 
        inspired by a family member’s entrepreneurial goals.
